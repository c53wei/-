# README

* Developed with Python version 3.9
* Required modules in `requirements.txt`
  * Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Path Finding Algorithms
* Our own implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is found in `path_finding.py`
* Implementations of A Star for comparison purposes is found in `a_star_algorithm.py` and `a_star_v2.py`

## Testing
* Pytests to benchmark runtime and performance are located in `test.py`
